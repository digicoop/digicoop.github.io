<p>
    Digicoop develops online collaborative tools to help team work better together so that
    they can deliver their projects or reach their goals more efficiently with a more collaborative
    approach.
</p>
<p>
    We are a French team that is passionate about technology, the web and what
    it can bring to society. We have all worked in the web industry for many years
    in agencies, startups or as freelancers. We are using our experience to build
    great products that we hope have a positive impact.
</p>
<p>
    We believe that businesses need to bring back some of their focus to the people
    which they are made of and that's why we have chosen to create Digicoop as a
    worker cooperative.
