<p>
    Digicoop develops online collaborative tools to help team work better together so that
    they can deliver their projects or reach their goals more efficiently with a more collaborative
    approach.
</p>
<p>
    We are a French team that is passionate about technology, the web and what
    it can bring to society. We are using our extensive experience to build
    great products that we hope have a positive impact.

<p>
    We believe that businesses need to bring back some of their focus to the people
    which they are made of. That's why we have chosen to create Digicoop as a
    worker cooperative, meaning a company owned by its employees (known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QhR_wM0MXk">SCOP</a> in France). On top of that we are <a href="https://zachholman.com/posts/remote-first/">remote-first</a>, almost completely paperless
    and managed using <a href="https://kantree.io">Kantree</a>.
